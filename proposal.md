### User Stories

- As a user, when I visit the website I see a search form where I can look for meals when I click the search button.
- As a user I can click on the search button to then retrieve a list of different meals by category (i.e Seafood, Chicken, Beef etc).
- As a user, I am able to see images of different meals that I've selected show up on the page.
